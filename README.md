# TCreator
TCreator is a modding tool for TModloader(Terraria) Mods.
You can create new Components for Terraria Mods without having to write any C# Code.
But for more advanced Modders you can also just edit the Source-Code of your Components in the Application.

This application is a Blazor Serverside web-application.


This is a highly WIP mainly created to make it a litle bit easier to create smaller Components for your Mods.
But you can also just create entire Mods with this App.
